# pyYamahaAVR

Easy to use generic python API to control your Yamaha AVR over the network.

## Basics
The API does not provide predefined commands/methods but provides a dynamic way to generate a command on the fly. Responses from the receiver will be mapped to a result object that provides the result as attributes. See [Usage](#usage) section to see this in action.

Search for [Yamaha RX Function Tree] to find an Excel workbook that defines all the commands that are supported. Or see the section [Optional command definition file](#optional-command-definition-file) to get a subset of commands available.

## Usage
```
>>> from avr import YamahaAPI
>>> api = YamahaAPI("http://<AVR_IP>/YamahaRemoteControl/ctrl")
>>>
>>> # Get power status
>>> api.Main_Zone.Power_Control.Power.get()
'Standby'
>>>
>>> # Set power status
>>> api.Main_Zone.Power_Control.Power.put("Standby")
>>> api.Main_Zone.Power_Control.Power = "On"
>>>
>>> # Set volume with multiple parameters
>>> api.Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl = { "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"", "Unit":"" }
>>>
>>> # Get volume and print result
>>> print(api.Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl.get())
Exp=1
Unit=dB
Val=-410
>>>
>>> # Another way to create commands
>>> cmd = api.create_command("Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl")
>>> print(cmd.get())
Exp=1
Unit=dB
Val=-400
>>> cmd.put({ "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"", "Unit":"" })
```

## Optional command definition file
You can also use and load a command definition file (see 'Yamaha_AVR_API.def') to be able to get a list of commands that are supported. This definition file is currenlty not complete and does not have all commands that your device supports. Pull requests for additional commands are welcome!
After loading the file you can print all available commands to get an overview of what is supported. You can also enable request validation to help spotting errors when trying to change values on the device. Trying to send an invalid command will then generate an exception.

```
>>> api.load_api_dictionary('Yamaha_AVR_API.def')
>>> api.print_available_commands()
Main_Zone.Power_Control.Sleep.PUT = ["Off", "30 min", "60 min", "90 min", "120 min", "Last"]
Main_Zone.Power_Control.Sleep.GET
Main_Zone.Power_Control.Power.PUT = ["Standby", "On", "On/Standby"]
Main_Zone.Power_Control.Power.GET
Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl.PUT = {Exp=[""], Unit=[""], Val=["Down", "Up", "Down 1 dB", "Up 1 dB", "Down 2 dB", "Up 2 dB", "Down 5 dB", "Up 5 dB"]}
Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl.GET
Main_Zone.Volume.Mute.PUT = ["On/Off"]
Main_Zone.Volume.Mute.GET
...
>>>
>>> api.enable_request_validation()
>>> api.Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl = { "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"", "Unit":"" }
>>>
>>> api.Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl = { "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"", "Unit":"x" }
exception.ValueNotSupportedException: Unsupported value 'x' (valid options: [u'']) for parameter 'Unit'
>>>
>>> api.Main_Zone.VolumeLvl = { "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"", "Unit":"" }
exception.CommandNotAvailableException: Command not available: 'Main_Zone.VolumeLvl'
>>>
>>> api.Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl = { "Val": "Up 1 dB", "Exp":"" }
exception.ParameterMissingException: Missing parameter 'Unit'
```
